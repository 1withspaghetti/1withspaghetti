# Hello ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a highschool junior who loves hiking, dogs, and creating websites!
I know Java, JS/TS, and HTML/CSS. I use them to make websites (frontend and backend), minecraft plugins, and discord bots. If you need help in any of those fields, go ahead and contact me and I will try my best to help!

I also have a personal website that shows off a few of my creations: https://1withspaghetti.com
