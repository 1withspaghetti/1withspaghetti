# Hello ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a high school senior who loves hiking, dogs, and creating websites!
I use Java Swing, Next.js, Vue, and by far my favorite, SvelteKit, to create school websites, personal projects, and [an advanced FIRST Robotics scouting app](https://github.com/ChainLynxRobotics/CLAW-ScoutingPWA).
I've also dipped my feet into C for IOT projects, with my most significant being a custom-made protogen fursuit head with a fluid, audio-reactive, neomatrix face controllable by RF remote or hand gestures via flex sensors embedded in paws.

I also have a personal website that shows off a few of my creations: https://1withspaghetti.com
It's not the most updated, however... ðŸ˜…
