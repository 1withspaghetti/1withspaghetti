# Hello 👋
### I'm a highschool sophomore who loves hiking, dogs, and creating websites!
I know Java, JS, and HTML/CSS. I use them to make websites (frontend and backend), minecraft plugins, and discord bots. If you need any help in any of those fields, go ahead and contact me and I will try my best to help. 😁
